    "#### Binomial distribution\n",
    "[Binomial distribution] is a discrete distribution, it is defined as the probability of $k$ $(k\\in\\mathbb{N})$ number of occurrences of an event in $n$ $(n\\in\\mathbb{N})$ trials. Each trial has exactly two possible outcomes: success with the probability of $p$ $(p\\in [0;1])$ and failure with the probability of $1-p$. The PMF of binomial distribution is:\n",
